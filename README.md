> Damien tells me there is still some work to do packaging this  
> correctly for Drupal, and removing the dependency on openssl, for  
> parsing the ASN.1 certificate. He has nearly finished  writing an ASN. 
> 1 parser in php for that, which should be useful for all the other php  
> apps.

> 	If other people are here with Drupal experience it may be worth  
> asking Damien how you can help test this code, improve the user  
> interface, and more. I'll keep you posted.
